# Marketing-Retail-Analytics-MRA-Project
An automobile parts manufacturing company has collected data on transactions for 3 years. They do not have any in-house data science team, thus they have hired you as their consultant. Your job is to use your data science skills to find the underlying buying patterns of the customers, provide the company with suitable insights about their customers, and recommend customized marketing strategies for different segments of customers.
